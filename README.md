# Bible Reader App DEMO
## What it does?
It displays the bible scriptures in different languages and bible versions from the [getBible API](https://github.com/getbible/v2).
It is capable of:
- Searching for a specific reference (e.g. John 3:16) - it will display the whole chapter while highlighting the verse specified
- Searching for key words - it will display a list of verses containing at least one key word
- Splitting View and Parallel View - it can open the same or different bible version/translation in a self contained Split view or In a Parallel view (e.g. two or more translations will be displayed side by side as one View)
- others: Font and Color customization

## Disclaimer
**This is a personal project made for fun and for learning purpose**. I advice against using this app (I will publish a professional one).

## Reason
Most of the application available (mobile excluded) are legacy and pretty outdated with an old UI, so I made a simple app for displaying the scripture during service time, with a pleasing look and optimized for this only purpose (e.g. many use Sword Bible but it's a bible study app with additional tools).
