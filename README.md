# Bible Reader App
I've noticed that most of the application available are pretty outdated and looks old (and some of them, e.g. e-sword, are commonly used but they are not actually made for this porpouse only), so I made a simple app for displaying the scripture during service time, with a pleasing look, using Tauri + Svelte. **This is a Project made for fun and for learning purpose**.
